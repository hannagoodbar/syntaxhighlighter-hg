# syntaxhighlighter-hg #
The syntaxhighlighter-hg project captures brush files I created for Alex Gorbatchev's syntaxhighlighter ([http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/), [https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter)). They were only hosted on my _blackrobes.net_ site, but since I'm making the move to GitHub, decided to make a project for them. 

## Installation ##
Copy the brush files into your _/syntaxhighlighter/scripts_ folder. Recommended using the autoloader ([http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/api/autoloader.html](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/api/autoloader.html)).

## Future ##
Since I'm moving the site to GitHub, will be relying more on GitHub's syntax highlighting than something external. Hoping to port these to Pygments lexers.
